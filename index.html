    <h2>Why Boats?</h2>

    <H3>I'll start with a correction, not boats, sailing dinghies. A dinghy is a type of small boat, often carried or towed by a larger vessel for use as a tender. Utility dinghies are usually rowboats or have an outboard motor. Some are rigged for sailing but they differ from sailing dinghies, which are designed first and foremost for sailing.</H3>
