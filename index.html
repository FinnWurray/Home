    <h2>Why Boats?</h2>

    <H3>I'll start with a correction, not boats, sailing dinghies. A dinghy is a type of small boat, often carried or towed by a larger vessel for use as a tender. We be looking at one-two person boats, ones I've sailed, ones I would like to Sail, and some of the most common sailing dinghies.  .</H3>
